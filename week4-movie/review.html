            <h2>REVIEW</h2>

            <p><strong>Javier Almeida</strong></p>
            <p><em>April 20, 2025</em></p>

            <p><em>Juice</em> is a powerful story about friendship, loyalty, and the pressure to gain respect on the streets. The film shows how choices can change a person, especially when power gets in the way of trust. Tupac Shakur gives a deep, intense performance as Bishop.</p>

            <p>I think <em>Juice</em> stands out because of how real and raw it feels. The music, setting, and acting all come together to show the struggles young men face when trying to define themselves. It's more than just a crime story â€” it's about identity, fear, and survival.</p>
